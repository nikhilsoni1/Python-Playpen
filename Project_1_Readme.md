## Project 1

#### Summary

This project shows the very basic operation that one would require for text analysis. Lessons learnt from this
project can be applied to process elements of a list on a large scale.

#### How-to

1. Ignore the code line/block where specified. These line/blocks generates the data for the problems
listed
2. Read the problem statement and write the solution in the blank lines that follows (you can take as many lines as you need)
3. Since this is a collaborative workshop and not a class, I have included the solution as well. Although
it is strongly recommended that you attempt the problems on your own first.

#### Applications

1. Processing a list of names/filenames.
2. Checking if a certain element is contained in a list of not
3. Iterative statements

#### Concepts Applied

1. If-else Statements
2. For loops
3. List subsetting
4. Range
